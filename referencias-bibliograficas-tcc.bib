abstract = {The rising abuse of computers and increasing threat to personal privacy through data banks have stimulated much interest in the technical safeguards for data. There are four kinds of safeguards, each related to but distinct from the others. Access controls regulate which users may enter the system and subsequently which data sets an active user may read or write. Flow controls regulate the dissemination of values among the data sets accessible to a user. Inference controls protect statistical databases by preventing questioners from deducing confidential information by posing carefully designed sequences of statistical queries and correlating the responses. Statistical data banks are much less secure than most people believe. Data encryption attempts to prevent unauthorized disclosure of confidential information in transit or in storage. This paper describes the general nature of controls of each type, the kinds of problems they can and cannot solve, and their inherent limitations and weaknesses. The paper is intended for a general audience with little background in the area.},

abstract = {The smart city is a new concept of urban development. It is about improving the life quality of city dwellers by making the city more adaptive and efficient, using new technologies that rely on an ecosystem of objects and services. The scope covering this new mode of city management includes: public infrastructures (buildings, street furniture, home automation, etc.), networks (water, electricity, gas, telecoms); transport (public transport, roads and smart cars, carpooling, so-called soft mobility - by bike, on foot, etc.); e-services and e-administrations.In recent years the concept of the smart city has become democratized, especially with the creation of several study groups and the establishment of more and more intelligent city in the world (New York, Paris, London ...). However, with the emergence of the Internet of Things (IOT) continues to boost the development of smart cities, it also increases the need to address security issues. The purpose of this article is the description of the data exchange flows between each component of the smart city and the users, to identify the types of protocol of these exchanges and the associated IOT applications.},

abstract = {Linux container mechanism has attracted a lot of attention and is increasingly utilized to deploy industry applications. Though it is a consensus that the container mechanism is not secure due to the kernel-sharing property, it lacks a concrete and systematical evaluation on its security using real world exploits. In this paper, we collect an attack dataset including 223 exploits that are effective on the container platform, and classify them into different categories using a two-dimensional attack taxonomy. Then we evaluate the security of existing Linux container mechanism using 88 typical exploits filtered out from the dataset. We find 50 (56.82%) exploits can successfully launch attacks from inside the container with the default configuration. Since the privilege escalation exploits can completely disable the container protection mechanism, we conduct an in-depth analysis on these exploits. We find the kernel security mechanisms such as Capability, Seccomp, and MAC play a more important role in preventing privilege escalation than the container isolation mechanisms (i.e., Namespace and Cgroup). However, the interdependence and mutual-influence relationship among these kernel security mechanisms may make them fall into the "short board effect" and impair their protection capability. By studying the 11 exploits that still can successfully break the isolation provided by container and achieve privilege escalation, we identify a common 4-step attack model followed by all 11 exploits. Finally, we propose a defense mechanism to effectively defeat those identified privilege escalation attacks.},

But information systems are exposed to serious internal and external threats that can have adverse effects on organizational operations. Unfortunately, the complexity of security attacks, and increased number of vulnerabilities, and lack of quality information security management implementation within organizations have greatly increased over the past few years, even the best security mechanisms can be bypassed by professional hackers. The author creates and develops a new perspective in information security management, and it introduces a new concept which is called total quality information security management, and it is designed, and applies toward quality of information security management.},

The solution for this problem assumes features of group control systems and robot systems from the security point of view. The main problem connected with the development of a security system for mobile robots is the distinction of this type of the network from other networks. This demands the development of special methods and approaches that should take many specific factors such as limitations of computational resources and power into account. The proposed solution for MRGC is based on the use of trust concept for finding the validity of nodes and finding targets. In contrast to the existing approaches, this protocol uses several parameters to evaluate the trust that allows to expand the range of repelled attacks.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a completely secure model to preserve privacy of location based services. We divide the mobile network into clusters. Each cluster is provided with a trusted authority. Any communication between the nodes which are located either inside or outside the cluster, takes place through the trusted authority. This system is a privacy-preserving proximity-based security system which does not require any pre-shared secret or public key infrastructure. This system implements a tag called spatial temporal location tag for authentication and session key establishment. Since these tags incorporate the unique physical features of signals, it cannot be easily forged. Each client has a public as well as a secret location tags. Hence this system is highly robust against masquerading attacks and eavesdroppers from outside the proximity range. The presence of a trusted authority provides security from attackers within the proximity range. The system increases the accuracy of authentication by using a nonparametric Bayesian method known as infinite Gaussian mixture model for performing the proximity test.},

abstract = {The events of a security protocol and their causal dependency can play an important role in the analysis of security properties. This insight underlies both strand spaces and the inductive method. But neither of these approaches builds up the events of a protocol in a compositional way, so that there is an informal spring from the protocol to its model. By broadening the models to certain kinds of Petri nets, a restricted form of contextual nets, a compositional event-based semantics is given to an economical, but expressive, language for describing security protocols; so the events and dependency of a wide range of protocols are determined once and for all. The net semantics is formally related to a transition semantics, strand spaces and inductive rules, as well as trace languages and event structures, so unifying a range of approaches, as well as providing conditions under which particular, more limited, models are adequate for the analysis of protocols. The net semantics allows the derivation of general properties and proof principles which are demonstrated in establishing an authentication property, following a diagrammatic style of proof.},

If a software architect wants to deploy some of these protocols in a system, they have to be sure that the protocol has the right properties as dictated by the requirements of the system. In this article we present BRUTUS, a tool for verifying properties of security protocols. This tool can be viewed as a special-purpose model checker for security protocols. We also present reduction techniques that make the tool efficient. Experimental results  are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of BRUTUS.},

The abstractions used provide insights on how the protocols work and foster the development of families of protocols sharing a common structure and properties. In contrast to post-hoc verification methods, protocols are developed together with their correctness proofs. We have implemented our method in Isabelle/HOL and used it to develop different entity authentication and key transport protocols.},

We give a detailed account of the methodology, compare its formal expressiveness to prior art, and describe its application to an open-source Java-implementation of the SSLprotocol. In particular, we show how one can make use of runtime verification to dynamically enforce that assumptions on the crypto-protocol implementations (that are commonly made when statically verifying crypto-protocol specifications against security requirements) are actually satisfied in a given protocol implementation at runtime. Our analysis of these properties shows that some important runtime correctness properties of the SSL-protocol exceed the commonly used class of safety properties, and as such also the expressiveness of other monitoring frameworks.},

abstract = {An identity-based online/offline encryption (IBOOE) scheme splits the encryption process into two phases. The first phase performs most of the heavy computations, such as modular exponentiation or pairing over points on elliptic curve. The knowledge of the plaintext or the receiver's identity is not required until the second phase, where the ciphertext is produced by only light computations, such as integer addition/multiplication or hashing. This division of computations makes encryption affordable by devices with limited computation power since the preparation works can be executed "offline" or possibly by some powerful devices. The identity-based (ID-based) nature of the scheme also allows the preparation of ciphertext without certificate verification.Since efficiency is the main concern, less burden in the computation requirements of all phases (i.e., both phases of encryption and the decryption phase) and smaller ciphertext size are desirable. In this paper, we propose new schemes with improved efficiency over previous schemes by assuming random oracles. Our first construction is a very efficient scheme secure against chosen-plaintext attack (CPA), which is just slightly modified from an existing scheme. We then proceed to propose a new notion called ID-based Online/Offline KEM (IBOOKEM) that allows the key encapsulation process to be split into offline and online stages, in the same way as IBOOE does. We also present a generic transformation to get security against chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) for IBOOE from any IBOOKEM scheme with one-wayness only. Our schemes (both CPA and CCA) are the most efficient one in the state-of-the-art, in terms of online computation and ciphertext size, which are the two main focuses of online/offline schemes. Our schemes are very suitable to be deployed on embedded devices such as smartcard or wireless sensor which have very limited computation powers and the communication bandwidth is very expensive.},

abstract = {The great diffusion of cloud computing applications and services in the last years has brought new threats to security of information. 1 IT Certification and authorization mechanisms try to provide assurance against those threats by leveraging high security standards and controls. Two examples of such certification based on IT security controls are ISO/IEC 27001 and FedRAMP. While these two certifications largely share their scope it is important to note that ISO is a standardization adopted worldwide since 2005 whereas FedRAMP was developed in 2012 specifically for US Government Cloud Service Providers. New frameworks, however, are not always more effective than earlier ones, especially in the fast-moving world of cloud computing where IT security standards need to be constantly updated.This study offers an overview of adequacy and completeness of ISO/IEC 27001 and FedRAMP, bringing to question the level of protection that they provide by comparing them to each other and evaluating both in terms of known threats to cloud computing. The study identifies weaknesses in the certification build process and highlights necessary improvements.},

abstract = {Security concerns are often mentioned amongst the reasons why organizations hesitate to adopt Cloud computing. Given that multiple Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) offer similar security services (e.g., "encryption key management") albeit with different capabilities and prices, the customers need to comparatively assess the offered security services in order to select the best CSP matching their security requirements. However, the presence of both explicit and implicit dependencies across security related services add further challenges for Cloud customers to (i) specify their security requirements taking service dependencies into consideration and (ii) to determine which CSP can satisfy these requirements. We present a framework to address these challenges. For challenge (i), our framework automatically detects conflicts resulting from inconsistent customer requirements. Moreover, our framework provides an explanation for the detected conflicts allowing customers to resolve these conflicts. To tackle challenge (ii), our framework assesses the security level provided by various CSPs and ranks the CSPs according to the desired customer requirements. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness with real-world CSP case studies derived from the Cloud Security Alliance's Security, Trust and Assurance Registry.},

abstract = {The security of clients' applications on the cloud platforms has been of great interest. Security concerns associated with cloud computing are improving in both the domains; security issues faced by cloud providers and security issues faced by clients. However, security concerns still remain in domains like cloud auditing and migrating application components to cloud to make the process more secure and cost-efficient. To an extent, this can be attributed to a lack of detailed information being publicly present about the cloud platforms and their security policies. A resolution in this regard can be found in Cloud Security Alliance's Security, Trust, and Assurance Registry (STAR) which documents the security controls provided by popular cloud computing offerings. In this paper, we perform some descriptive analysis on STAR data in an attempt to comprehend the information publicly presented by different cloud providers. It is to help clients in more effectively searching and analyzing the required security information they need for the decision making process for hosting their applications on cloud. Based on the analysis, we outline some augmentations that can be made to STAR as well as certain specific design improvements for a cloud migration risk assessment framework.},

abstract = {The cloud computing paradigm has become a mainstream solution for the deployment of business processes and applications. In the public cloud vision, infrastructure, platform, and software services are provisioned to tenants (i.e., customers and service providers) on a pay-as-you-go basis. Cloud tenants can use cloud resources at lower prices, and higher performance and flexibility, than traditional on-premises resources, without having to care about infrastructure management. Still, cloud tenants remain concerned with the cloud’s level of service and the nonfunctional properties their applications can count on. In the last few years, the research community has been focusing on the nonfunctional aspects of the cloud paradigm, among which cloud security stands out. Several approaches to security have been described and summarized in general surveys on cloud security techniques. The survey in this article focuses on the interface between cloud security and cloud security assurance. First, we provide an overview of the state of the art on cloud security. Then, we introduce the notion of cloud security assurance and analyze its growing impact on cloud security approaches. Finally, we present some recommendations for the development of next-generation cloud security and assurance solutions.},

In projects these are often addressed late in the software development life-cycle, because these are difficult to elicit in cloud scenarios, due to the large amount of stakeholders and technologies involved. We contribute a catalog of security and privacy requirement patterns that support software engineers in eliciting these requirements. As requirements patterns provide artifacts for re-using requirements. This paper shows how these requirements can be classified according to cloud security and privacy goals. Furthermore, we provide a structured method on how to elicit the right requirements for a given scenario. We mined these requirements patterns from existing security analysis of public organizations such as ENISA and the Cloud Security Alliance, from our practical experience in the cloud domain, and from our previous research in cloud security. We validate our requirements patterns in co-operation with industrial partners of the ClouDAT project.},

abstract = {Cloud services have recently been expanding rapidly, but business users are still in the minority compared with consumer users. From the viewpoint of organizational risk management, it is necessary to control the risks of the cloud computing environment used as part of an organization's information system in order to minimize any negative influence on the organization's mission or business processes. In a previous article, the authors divided cloud security metrics into two security levels. One level shows how the security metrics influence the mission or business processes in 27 dimensions. The other level shows the security status at the time and the influence range when an incident occurs. This article focuses the latter variable security level and describes the results of developing a cloud security visualization system that was designed based on collection, analysis, and visualization architecture to calculate the level. From the viewpoint of security risk management, the system is considerered to be effective for cloud service providers because it reduces the time needed to investigate the cause of incidents and to recover from them, it helps in triage assessment when many incidents happen simultaneously, and it can detect warnings of an incident and forestall such incidents before they occur.},

To take advantage of all the benefits of cloud computing, it is necessary to have security and privacy requirements for the implementation and use of the cloud.A company planning to implement a public cloud solution should be aware of the risks associated with cloud computing. This is due to the rapidly evolving threats to cloud security that are emerging at an increasing rate in recent years, also to multi-tenant and open nature of the public cloud.A risk analysis must be done initially with a cloud provider in order to identify the existing vulnerabilities and to implement the measures to counter those threats.This paper explores the key issues surrounding cloud security, and passes on valuable guidance about not only information security and broadly risk. Also, it will help providers to make informed security decisions about their diverse cloud set-ups and better understand how to reap all the benefits of cloud without compromising their organizations' security. As well, it discusses the security requirements, and various risks related to the public cloud.},

abstract = {Cloud security becomes a hot topic in the emerging new cloud environments. Customers would like to understand what happens when they move their applications, data and information on the cloud. Probably one of the most interesting questions is what are the new challenges that cloud virtual environment produces due to multitenancy and virtualization.Security challenges addressed in this paper are vulnerabilities that may happen inside or outside the cloud environment. The security evaluation methodology uses Nessus scoring system for two target groups: physical and software parts using different scenarios. Our experiments are realized with four virtual machine instances instantiated in Eucalyptus cloud with different operating systems hosted. We also evaluate the security of the Eucalyptus cloud version.},
