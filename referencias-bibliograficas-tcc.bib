  abstract   = {The rising abuse of computers and increasing threat to personal privacy through data banks have stimulated much interest in the technical safeguards for data. There are four kinds of safeguards, each related to but distinct from the others. Access controls regulate which users may enter the system and subsequently which data sets an active user may read or write. Flow controls regulate the dissemination of values among the data sets accessible to a user. Inference controls protect statistical databases by preventing questioners from deducing confidential information by posing carefully designed sequences of statistical queries and correlating the responses. Statistical data banks are much less secure than most people believe. Data encryption attempts to prevent unauthorized disclosure of confidential information in transit or in storage. This paper describes the general nature of controls of each type, the kinds of problems they can and cannot solve, and their inherent limitations and weaknesses. The paper is intended for a general audience with little background in the area.},

  abstract  = {The smart city is a new concept of urban development. It is about improving the life quality of city dwellers by making the city more adaptive and efficient, using new technologies that rely on an ecosystem of objects and services. The scope covering this new mode of city management includes: public infrastructures (buildings, street furniture, home automation, etc.), networks (water, electricity, gas, telecoms); transport (public transport, roads and smart cars, carpooling, so-called soft mobility - by bike, on foot, etc.); e-services and e-administrations.In recent years the concept of the smart city has become democratized, especially with the creation of several study groups and the establishment of more and more intelligent city in the world (New York, Paris, London ...). However, with the emergence of the Internet of Things (IOT) continues to boost the development of smart cities, it also increases the need to address security issues. The purpose of this article is the description of the data exchange flows between each component of the smart city and the users, to identify the types of protocol of these exchanges and the associated IOT applications.},

  abstract  = {The great diffusion of cloud computing applications and services in the last years has brought new threats to security of information. 1 IT Certification and authorization mechanisms try to provide assurance against those threats by leveraging high security standards and controls. Two examples of such certification based on IT security controls are ISO/IEC 27001 and FedRAMP. While these two certifications largely share their scope it is important to note that ISO is a standardization adopted worldwide since 2005 whereas FedRAMP was developed in 2012 specifically for US Government Cloud Service Providers. New frameworks, however, are not always more effective than earlier ones, especially in the fast-moving world of cloud computing where IT security standards need to be constantly updated.This study offers an overview of adequacy and completeness of ISO/IEC 27001 and FedRAMP, bringing to question the level of protection that they provide by comparing them to each other and evaluating both in terms of known threats to cloud computing. The study identifies weaknesses in the certification build process and highlights necessary improvements.},

  abstract  = {Security concerns are often mentioned amongst the reasons why organizations hesitate to adopt Cloud computing. Given that multiple Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) offer similar security services (e.g., "encryption key management") albeit with different capabilities and prices, the customers need to comparatively assess the offered security services in order to select the best CSP matching their security requirements. However, the presence of both explicit and implicit dependencies across security related services add further challenges for Cloud customers to (i) specify their security requirements taking service dependencies into consideration and (ii) to determine which CSP can satisfy these requirements. We present a framework to address these challenges. For challenge (i), our framework automatically detects conflicts resulting from inconsistent customer requirements. Moreover, our framework provides an explanation for the detected conflicts allowing customers to resolve these conflicts. To tackle challenge (ii), our framework assesses the security level provided by various CSPs and ranks the CSPs according to the desired customer requirements. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness with real-world CSP case studies derived from the Cloud Security Alliance's Security, Trust and Assurance Registry.},

While some are inherited from general security concepts like security attributes (confidentiality, integrity, and availability), others are based on cloud specific characteristics such as cloud service models and stakeholders' roles. Despite the extensive body of research on developing classifications for cloud computing security, a study on the principles and dimensions of these classifications have largely escaped rigorous analysis. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the existing cloud computing security classifications, taxonomies, and ontologies. We explore their strengths, limitations, and effective use in an attempt to draw the general properties for a holistic framework that can provide a comprehensive view of cloud computing security and help better understand this evolving field.

  abstract  = {The security of clients' applications on the cloud platforms has been of great interest. Security concerns associated with cloud computing are improving in both the domains; security issues faced by cloud providers and security issues faced by clients. However, security concerns still remain in domains like cloud auditing and migrating application components to cloud to make the process more secure and cost-efficient. To an extent, this can be attributed to a lack of detailed information being publicly present about the cloud platforms and their security policies. A resolution in this regard can be found in Cloud Security Alliance's Security, Trust, and Assurance Registry (STAR) which documents the security controls provided by popular cloud computing offerings. In this paper, we perform some descriptive analysis on STAR data in an attempt to comprehend the information publicly presented by different cloud providers. It is to help clients in more effectively searching and analyzing the required security information they need for the decision making process for hosting their applications on cloud. Based on the analysis, we outline some augmentations that can be made to STAR as well as certain specific design improvements for a cloud migration risk assessment framework.},

  abstract   = {The public Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud industry has reached a critical mass in the past few years, with many cloud service providers fielding competing services. Despite the competition, we find some of the security mechanisms offered by the services to be similar, indicating that the cloud industry has established a number of “best-practices,” while other security mechanisms vary widely, indicating that there is also still room for innovation and experimentation. We investigate these differences and possible underlying reasons for it. We also contrast the security mechanisms offered by public IaaS cloud offerings and with security mechanisms proposed by academia over the same period. Finally, we speculate on how industry and academia might work together to solve the pressing security problems in public IaaS clouds going forward.},

  abstract   = {The cloud computing paradigm has become a mainstream solution for the deployment of business processes and applications. In the public cloud vision, infrastructure, platform, and software services are provisioned to tenants (i.e., customers and service providers) on a pay-as-you-go basis. Cloud tenants can use cloud resources at lower prices, and higher performance and flexibility, than traditional on-premises resources, without having to care about infrastructure management. Still, cloud tenants remain concerned with the cloud’s level of service and the nonfunctional properties their applications can count on. In the last few years, the research community has been focusing on the nonfunctional aspects of the cloud paradigm, among which cloud security stands out. Several approaches to security have been described and summarized in general surveys on cloud security techniques. The survey in this article focuses on the interface between cloud security and cloud security assurance. First, we provide an overview of the state of the art on cloud security. Then, we introduce the notion of cloud security assurance and analyze its growing impact on cloud security approaches. Finally, we present some recommendations for the development of next-generation cloud security and assurance solutions.},

  abstract  = {Security and privacy concerns are essential in cloud computing scenarios, because cloud customers and end customers have to trust the cloud provider with their critical business data and even their IT infrastructure. In projects these are often addressed late in the software development life-cycle, because these are difficult to elicit in cloud scenarios, due to the large amount of stakeholders and technologies involved. We contribute a catalog of security and privacy requirement patterns that support software engineers in eliciting these requirements. As requirements patterns provide artifacts for re-using requirements. This paper shows how these requirements can be classified according to cloud security and privacy goals. Furthermore, we provide a structured method on how to elicit the right requirements for a given scenario. We mined these requirements patterns from existing security analysis of public organizations such as ENISA and the Cloud Security Alliance, from our practical experience in the cloud domain, and from our previous research in cloud security. We validate our requirements patterns in co-operation with industrial partners of the ClouDAT project.},

  abstract  = {Cloud services have recently been expanding rapidly, but business users are still in the minority compared with consumer users. From the viewpoint of organizational risk management, it is necessary to control the risks of the cloud computing environment used as part of an organization's information system in order to minimize any negative influence on the organization's mission or business processes. In a previous article, the authors divided cloud security metrics into two security levels. One level shows how the security metrics influence the mission or business processes in 27 dimensions. The other level shows the security status at the time and the influence range when an incident occurs. This article focuses the latter variable security level and describes the results of developing a cloud security visualization system that was designed based on collection, analysis, and visualization architecture to calculate the level. From the viewpoint of security risk management, the system is considerered to be effective for cloud service providers because it reduces the time needed to investigate the cause of incidents and to recover from them, it helps in triage assessment when many incidents happen simultaneously, and it can detect warnings of an incident and forestall such incidents before they occur.},

  abstract  = {The cloud computing is a powerful technology in IT environment to provide cost effective, easy to manage, elastic, provide on-demand scalable services over the Internet and is wish list of many organizations that they are still concerned about the security risks implied by moving their infrastructure into cloud computing, and by integrating their resources within the cloud computing environment.. To take advantage of all the benefits of cloud computing, it is necessary to have security and privacy requirements for the implementation and use of the cloud.A company planning to implement a public cloud solution should be aware of the risks associated with cloud computing. This is due to the rapidly evolving threats to cloud security that are emerging at an increasing rate in recent years, also to multi-tenant and open nature of the public cloud.A risk analysis must be done initially with a cloud provider in order to identify the existing vulnerabilities and to implement the measures to counter those threats.This paper explores the key issues surrounding cloud security, and passes on valuable guidance about not only information security and broadly risk. Also, it will help providers to make informed security decisions about their diverse cloud set-ups and better understand how to reap all the benefits of cloud without compromising their organizations' security. As well, it discusses the security requirements, and various risks related to the public cloud.},

  abstract  = {Cloud security becomes a hot topic in the emerging new cloud environments. Customers would like to understand what happens when they move their applications, data and information on the cloud. Probably one of the most interesting questions is what are the new challenges that cloud virtual environment produces due to multitenancy and virtualization.Security challenges addressed in this paper are vulnerabilities that may happen inside or outside the cloud environment. The security evaluation methodology uses Nessus scoring system for two target groups: physical and software parts using different scenarios. Our experiments are realized with four virtual machine instances instantiated in Eucalyptus cloud with different operating systems hosted. We also evaluate the security of the Eucalyptus cloud version.},
